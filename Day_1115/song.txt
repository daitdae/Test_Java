Now that I got a taste
I think that I'd suffocate
For every second that you aren't by my side
But now I'm stuck at the gate
Of Lucifer's estate
I fell in love with a girl I met in Hell
Thinking about all the things
The way you pull my strings
I love the way you turn me on
I ain't Hades, but I'm the King
I'd do anything
So that I could take you home
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
